// Both halves now live in `rbx_core::env`: the Studio lookup, and the
// `RBXAPIKEY_COOKIE` variable this used to read first. The notice string went
// with them: it was duplicated here byte-for-byte and pinned by a test, which
// is the cost of having had two sites at all.

// `authenticated_user` was here: a second `users/authenticated` request with
// its own URL literal, its own error mapping and no memory of having been
// asked before. It is `RbxApiKeyClient::authenticated_account` now, over
// `rbx_core::session`, which is also what the preflight in
// `require_valid_session` consults: one call per run, one wording for a
// refusal, and one place holding the host.

// The test that used to sit here pinned this crate's copy of the notice
// against rbx-core's, the only thing linking two literals that had to stay
// identical. There is one literal now, so there is nothing left to pin.

/// What `rbx-core` owns (the statuses, the caching, the wording) is tested
/// there. What this owns is that its client asks the right host with the right
/// cookie, that the creator-id lookup and the preflight are the same question,
