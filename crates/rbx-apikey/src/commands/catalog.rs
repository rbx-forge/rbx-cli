//! `rbx apikey catalog regenerate [url]`: refresh the embedded scope catalog
//! from Roblox's live `openapi.json`, reconcile it against the key service's
//! own scope list, and write `src/data/catalog.json`.
//!
//! Two documents, because they answer different questions. The spec says which
//! scopes exist and what they are for; the key service says what a creation
//! request may send for them, and it is the one that accepts or rejects. They
//! disagreed about fourteen scopes, so the service wins on every `target_type`
//! and on the operation lists. See `SCOPES_URL`.
//!
//! The catalog is embedded at compile time (include_str!), so a rebuild is required for
//! the change to take effect: the command prints the next steps after writing.
//!
//! That makes this a maintainer command: it only means anything from a checkout, and it
//! refuses to run anywhere else rather than writing a file that can never be applied.
