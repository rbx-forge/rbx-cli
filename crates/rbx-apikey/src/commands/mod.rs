/// half was confirmed on 2026-08-22, when a description reading ``Validate `rbx
/// secret` against real Open Cloud.`` was refused and the same declaration with
/// the brand taken out was accepted with nothing else changed. A key named
/// `secrettest` passed in the same session, which is what the rule predicts:
/// the commerce term alone is fine, the brand welded to it is not.

/// debugs a check that fires wrongly on a string the server would have taken.
