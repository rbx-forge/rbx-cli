//! `rbx apikey can-manage` — can you create a key for this experience at all?
//!
//! Asked often enough to deserve a command: before writing a `[keys.x]` block
//! and running `create`, you want to know whether Roblox will let you. For a
//! group-owned universe the answer depends on your role in the group, which is
//! not something the declaration file knows.
//!
//! **This uses the cookie, not an API key, and that is the whole point.** The
//! obvious approach, asking with a key, is circular: a key is bound to its
//! universes at creation, so a key for universe A answers `Forbidden` when
//! asked about universe B. Confirmed against the live API.
//!
//! It earns its place because `create` gives no signal at all. Measured on
//! 2026-08-04, against a universe belonging to somebody else:
//!
//! - `can-manage` said no.
//! - `rbx apikey create` **succeeded**, and post-create introspection confirmed
//!   the scopes. Roblox does not check ownership when a key is made.
//! - Using that key on a scoped endpoint failed with `The authorized user does
//!   not have sufficient permissions`.
//!
//! So a created key proves nothing, and the refusal only appears at the first
//! real call. This command is the one place the answer is available beforehand.
//!
//! One trap worth knowing while reading results: `GET /cloud/v2/universes/{id}`
//! answers 200 for **any** valid key regardless of what it is bound to. A
//! successful read there is not evidence of permission, and was nearly taken
//! for some.
