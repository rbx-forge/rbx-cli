//! Drift validation: bail when the lockfile's `[envs.<name>]` snapshot
//! disagrees with what the env currently resolves to via `rbxplace.toml`.
//!
//! Used by every command that touches Roblox state (create, update, delete,
//! regenerate, status). Centralized here so the message and the comparison
//! logic stay identical across commands.
//!
//! Schema v4 made drift per-env rather than per-key: with envs lifted out
//! of `LockEntry`, the only thing that can drift is the cached
//! `(universe_id, owner)` tuple for an env shared by many keys.
