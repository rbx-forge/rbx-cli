//! Reading the shape `introspect` answers with.
//!
//! Roblox does not echo back what it was sent. A scope goes out as
//! `{scopeType, targetParts, operations}` and comes back from
//! `/cloud-authentication/v1/apiKey/introspect` as
//! `{name, operations, universeIds}`: a different name for the type, a
//! different name for the target, and targets typed as universe ids rather
//! than the `U<id>` / `G<id>` / `*` strings a creator-targeted scope is sent
//! with.
//!
//! ## The target does not always arrive in `universeIds`
//!
//! It is not one field. The same key comes back carrying targets under at
//! least three names, and which one is used follows the scope:
//!
//! | Field | Seen on |
//! |---|---|
//! | `universeIds: [id]` | `universe`, `universe-places`, `universe-datastores.control` |
//! | `universeDatastores: [{universeId}]` | `universe-datastores.objects`, `.versions` |
//! | `groupIds: [id]` | `asset` |
//!
//! Reading only the first is what issue #37 reported: a scope stored exactly
//! as asked was announced as missing on its universe *and* as unasked on `*`,
//! the two warnings mirroring each other, because a target this module could
//! not find became the `*` that means "no target at all".
//!
//! So a target field this build does not know is now an error rather than a
//! wildcard. That is the same rule the section below already applied to an
//! unreadable entry, and for the same reason: the failure this module exists
//! to prevent is a reader that quietly turns "not understood" into a
//! confident, wrong answer. `*` stays the reading of a scope that carries no
//! target field at all, which is how a badge or creator scope is sent.
//!
//! ## How this was found
//!
//! Not by a test. Every test in this crate feeds the parser something this
//! crate wrote, so a parser that only understands what we send passes all of
//! them. It was found by creating a key against real Open Cloud and reading
//! the answer, on 2026-08-16.
//!
//! What made it invisible for longer is that both readers failed *quietly*.
//! `diagnostics::introspect_scopes` collected with `filter_map(... .ok())`,
//! so entries that did not deserialise were dropped one by one until nothing
//! was left, and an empty scope list reads as "this key grants nothing"
//! rather than as "this was not understood". `create`'s post-create check
//! counted the raw JSON array instead of the parsed one, so it compared 5
//! against 5 and reported a match it had not verified.
