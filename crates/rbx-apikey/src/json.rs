//! What `rbx apikey list --json`, `status --json` and `scopes show --json`
//! write to stdout.
//!
//! The envelope follows `rbx check --json`: a `schema_version` first, then
//! named objects all the way down, optional fields omitted rather than emitted
//! as `null`, ids as strings. Field names are documented in `docs/apikey.md`
//! and are the compatibility surface.
//!
//! ## No secret, and no piece of one
//!
//! This crate holds live Open Cloud credentials. A document it writes goes into
//! a pipe, a CI log, an artifact upload, a monitoring agent — places a secret
//! must never reach, and where nobody will notice it did until the key has to
//! be rotated. So the rule here is absolute and structural rather than
//! careful: **no field in this module ever carries a secret or any part of
//! one.**
//!
//! Two things follow from it that are worth stating, because both are fields
//! the human form does print:
//!
//! - **`list --remote` has no `secret_preview`.** The Creator Hub's "Key"
//!   column, and the human listing's fourth column, is the first characters of
//!   a live secret. It is there so a person can recognise a key on their own
//!   screen. A prefix is still credential material, and a document is not a
//!   screen.
//! - **`list` has no path to the secret file.** The human form prints
//!   `set (file: .secrets/deploy.env)` because the person reading it is
//!   standing in that directory. `secret_backend` says which of the two
//!   backends holds it and `secret_present` says whether it is there, which is
//!   what a script needs; where on disk a credential lives is not something to
//!   publish alongside it.
//!
//! ## What else is deliberately absent
//!
//! A document says no more than the human form already says out loud, and these
//! commands talk about credentials, so the line is drawn tightly.
//!
//! `status` carries no free-text detail. The human form's trailing sentence is
//! advice for a person — "run `rbx apikey regenerate <name>`" — and one of its
//! branches names the secret file. `status` is derivable from the same
//! verdicts, so the document carries the verdict and drops the sentence.
//!
//! `list --remote` carries no `id`. The account listing prints a name, a
//! preview, dates and a tracked tag, and never the `cloud_auth_id`; most of the
//! keys it returns belong to other checkouts and other tools. The local
//! listing does print `id` for the keys this project created, and the document
//! carries it there.
