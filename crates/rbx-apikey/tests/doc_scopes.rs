//! Every scope named in the documentation has to exist.
//!
//! This test is here because it was missing, and its absence cost real time.
//! `docs/import.md` told people to ask for `universe.image:read` and
//! `legacy-universe.badge:read`. Neither exists: the first is not a scope type
//! at all, and the second has only `write` and `manage-and-spend-robux`.
//! Somebody following the page got `400 Response.InvalidScopes` from Roblox,
//! which is a bad place to learn that a documented scope was invented.
//!
//! Two things made it survivable for so long, and both are worth knowing:
//!
//! - **The tool is deliberately forgiving.** An unknown scope is a warning and
//!   exit 0, because the catalog ships with the binary and Roblox adds scopes
//!   between releases. That is right, and it means a wrong scope in a page
//!   surfaces only when somebody creates a key with it.
//! - **Nothing read the scope tables.** The workspace already scans `docs/` for
//!   one class of factual claim — `rbx-core/tests/binary_names.rs` checks that
//!   no page names a command this tool does not have — and the authoritative
//!   list of scopes sat in this very crate the whole time. The pattern existed;
//!   nobody pointed it at scopes.
//!
//! What this refuses is narrow on purpose: a scope *type* the catalog does not
//! know, or an *operation* the catalog does not list for a type it does know.
//! It is not a claim that the catalog is complete — it is not, and
//! `KNOWN_ABSENT` below is where that gets recorded rather than papered over.
