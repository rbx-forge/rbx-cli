//! The Open Cloud Configs API, which is one transport serving several products.
//!
//! `/creator-configs-public-api/v1/configs/universes/{id}/repositories/{repo}`
//! takes the repository as a **path parameter**, and every verb under it is
//! identical whichever repository is named: stage a draft, read it, publish it,
//! list revisions, restore one.
//!
//! This lived in `rbx-config` with the repository welded in as a constant, which
//! made seven of the eight repositories unreachable and would have made a second
//! consumer copy the client. `rbx_core::api::send_with_csrf` is here for exactly
//! the same reason: four crates carried their own copy until they started
//! disagreeing about whether `204` was a success.
//!
//! # What the repositories hold
//!
//! Only two are documented. `InExperienceConfig` is the live config
//! `ConfigService` reads in-experience. `DataStoresConfig` holds the
//! right-to-be-forgotten deletion templates, documented on a different page
//! than the configs guide, whose repository table still lists one row.
//!
//! The other six are in the enum and documented nowhere. That is deliberate on
//! Roblox's side, and the enum's own description says so: "Only values exposed
//! by the public API are included; internal repository types are not exposed to
//! allow development and testing before enabling." They are forward
//! declarations, so this module carries the transport and takes no view on what
//! any repository's entries mean.

/// Body for `PUT /draft:overwrite` and `PATCH /draft`.

/// configs guide says the latter in prose; the vendored spec's
/// `UpdateDraftRequest` defines `draftHash` ("The previous draft hash for
/// concurrency control") and does not mention `previousDraftHash` anywhere.
///
/// The spec wins, and here the choice is not a coin flip: `UpdateDraftRequest`
/// carries `additionalProperties: false`, so the guide's spelling would be
/// **rejected** rather than ignored, and every `sync` against a repository with
/// a staged draft would fail on an opaque 4xx. Sending the spec's name is also
/// the safe side of the other branch: if the service happened to want the
/// guide's name, the guard is merely inert, which is where this code was before
/// it sent anything at all.
///
/// **`conditionalRules` is not the optional extra it looks like.** The same
/// schema says that on `PUT draft:overwrite` a present property is "the full
/// intended rule set after publish", and that when the property is omitted
/// "all published conditional rules are cleared (entries must not reference
/// conditionals unless you provide this object)". So absent and `{}` are not
/// interchangeable here and neither is a safe default: the field stays
/// `Option` so the distinction survives to the wire, and the absent case is
/// only sent when there is genuinely no rule to keep, which
/// [`ConfigsClient::conditional_rules_to_restate`] is what decides.
