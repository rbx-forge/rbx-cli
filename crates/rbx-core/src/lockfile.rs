//! Shared lockfile loading: version validation and stepwise migration.
//!
//! Every lockfile in the suite (`rbxmeta.lock.toml`, `rbxshop.lock.toml`, ...)
//! carries a `version` integer. Writing it is easy; the value only earns its
//! keep if something reads it back. Three behaviours live here so each lockfile
//! inherits all of them at once:
//!
//! 1. **Refuse anything newer than this build.** A lockfile written by a newer
//!    `rbx` is not something we can safely guess at, and parsing it as the
//!    current version would drop or misread state without saying so. The error
//!    names both versions and points at the real fix (upgrade) rather than
//!    surfacing a parse failure the user cannot act on.
//! 2. **Migrate older versions forward, one step at a time**, through
//!    [`LockfileFormat::migrations`]. Registries are keyed `"N -> N+1"` and
//!    applied in sequence until the file reaches the current version.
//! 3. **One helper**, so behaviour cannot drift between lockfiles.
//!
//! Writing goes through [`write()`] for the same reason: a `sync` rewrites its
//! lockfile after every resource it creates, and the retry that keeps an
//! editor from stopping that run halfway belongs to every lockfile at once.
//!
//! The migration registries are empty today, and that is the point: the
//! enforcement point has to exist *before* lockfiles are in the wild, because
//! it is the part that cannot be retrofitted cheaply afterwards. This mirrors
//! the project's own "an ignored key must not pass for applied" policy for
//! `rbx env` (see `docs/env.md`): a version we silently ignore is a version we
//! silently claim to have honoured.

///
/// - **Unix:** the file is created with mode `0600`, so there is no moment where
///   it exists with the umask's default (usually `0644`). `mode` only applies at
///   creation, so a file that already existed is tightened before the secret is
///   written into it.
/// - **Windows:** inheritance is removed and the current user is the only
///   account granted access, through `icacls`, before the secret is written. A
///   file in a profile folder is already private by inheritance, but one on
///   another drive (a repository on `D:\`, say) usually inherits a grant to
///   every authenticated user. If `icacls` fails, a warning names the file and
