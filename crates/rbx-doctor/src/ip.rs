//! Step 3: the key's allowed CIDRs against this machine's public IP.
//!
//! A stale allowlist entry is refused with the same opaque 401 as a wrong
//! secret, which is the failure `doctor` exists to name. Making the comparison
//! needs one thing nothing else in this workspace has: the caller's public
//! address, which a machine behind NAT cannot read off its own interfaces. The
//! only way to learn it is to ask something on the outside.
//!
//! So this module is behind `--check-ip` and does nothing unless asked. Three
//! rules shape it:
//!
//! 1. **One request, to a host that is named in the output.** `rbx` argues for
//!    least privilege; it does not get to quietly tell a third party where you
//!    are. The service is printed next to the answer, not only documented.
//! 2. **A lookup that fails is a check that could not run.** Offline, service
//!    down, timed out: none of those mean the IP is outside the allowlist, and
//!    reporting them as a mismatch would send somebody editing a key that is
//!    fine.
//! 3. **A short, explicit timeout.** `doctor` is the command people run when
//!    the network is already misbehaving, so it stays usable offline.
