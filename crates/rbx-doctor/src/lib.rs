//! `rbx doctor`: answer "why doesn't it work" before the user has to guess.
//!
//! Five checks, in the order a failure cascades: which credentials are active
//! and whether the session cookie is still one, whether that key is still
//! valid, what its IP allowlist says, whether it carries the scopes the tools
//! configured here need, and whether one real authenticated read succeeds. Each
//! is read-only. `doctor` never creates, updates or deletes anything.
//!
//! # The one check that is opt-in
//!
//! Comparing the key's CIDRs against the caller's public IP needs an address a
//! machine behind NAT cannot read off its own interfaces, so it means asking a
//! third party. `doctor` does not do that on its own initiative: without
//! `--check-ip` the allowlist is printed and explicitly not compared, and no
//! packet leaves for anyone but Roblox. With the flag, one request goes to the
//! service named in the output and in `docs/doctor.md`. See `ip`.
//!
//! # Exit status
//!
//! `0` when nothing is broken, `1` when a check failed. A check that could not
//! run is not a failure and does not change the status, but it is never
//! reported as a pass either, and the summary line says how many there were.
