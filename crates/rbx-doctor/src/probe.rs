//! Step 5: one cheap authenticated read, to confirm the whole chain works.
//!
//! Every other check reads something local or asks Roblox about the key's
//! *configuration*. None of them proves a call actually succeeds: a key can be
//! enabled, unexpired and correctly scoped and still be refused, most often by
//! an IP allowlist that no longer contains the caller. #52 quotes
//! `testenv/rbxapikey.toml` on exactly this, about a stale allowed-CIDR entry:
//! "A stale entry fails as an opaque 401, so check this first when a call that
//! should work does not."
//!
//! `GET /cloud/v2/universes/{id}` is the probe: one scope (`universe:read`),
//! no side effects, no cost, and it is the same request `rbx meta` opens with,
//! so a failure here is a failure the user was going to hit anyway.
