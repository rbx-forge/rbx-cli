//! "Is my cookie still good", which is exactly the question `doctor` exists to
//! answer, and the one it used to leave out.
//!
//! Step 1 reported where the cookie came from and stopped there, so a run could
//! print a green credentials section for a session Roblox had stopped
//! accepting. Every command that needs the cookie would then fail somewhere
//! else, with a message about the resource rather than about the session — and
//! `rbx meta sync` would fail halfway through (#63).
//!
//! One `users/authenticated` call answers it. `doctor` already spends
//! cookie-bearing calls listing the account's keys, so this is not a new kind
//! of traffic, and `rbx_core::session` caches the verdict, so the check and any
//! other question about the same cookie in this process cost one round trip.
